A. Location of contacts in the linear genome
################################################################################
1. Density plot of the nearest distance (log10 transformed) to chromosome ends 
of the midPoints of unique bins per Cp (combined for all chr). 

2. Distance of bin midpoints to reference points in the genome marking certain 
areas i.e. chr ends, centromere midpoints. Note that R rounds up >= XXXXXXX.5 
values to nearest integer when printing which could also happen when saving.
If last bin shorter than bin resolution, populate output matrix row with NAs.
Did not take unique bins per Cp so the subsequent density of distances would
reflect frequency of contacts formed by each bin. 

Output is IJDISTTOREF.MX:
> head(IJDISTTOREF.MX)
     chr.start.bp chr.end.bp centromere.midP.bp Cp
[1,]      59999.5 -133791894          -36296694  3
[2,]      59999.5 -133791894          -36296694  1
[3,]     139999.5 -133711894          -36216694  2
[4,]     139999.5 -133711894          -36216694  6
[5,]     179999.5 -133671894          -36176694 15
[6,]      99999.5 -133751894          -36256694  1

The signs of the distances in IJDISTTOREF.MX can tell whether the bin is
upstream or downstream of the reference points, which are the chromosome
start, end and centromere midpoint. Distances were calculated to be
bin midpoints - reference points so all distances from the start should be
positive or 0 and all distances relative to end should be negative or 0. For
the distance to centromere midpoint, negative values mean that the bins are
upstream while positive means that the bins are downstream of the centromere midpoint.

2.5 Density plot of log10 absoluet distances (in bp) from reference points. 

3. Combining all chromosome data, plot minimum distance of contact bin midpoint
to centromere midpoint divided by length of arm, where bin is located. If
value is positive (because min distance is positive) the bin is located downstream
of centromere midpoint, if the value is negative (because min distance is negative) 
the bin is located upstream of centromere midpoint. Because the minimum distance
values were calculated as bin midpoint minus centromere midpoint using 1-based
coordinates, the same is done for arm lengths i.e. centromere midpoints minus
chromosome start or end in 1-based CS.
