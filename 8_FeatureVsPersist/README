A. Enrichment of genomic and chromatin features in the contacting bins and their
neighboring bins
################################################################################
Note: Enrichment measured as the % of contacting bins (per cp) containing a 
given feature.

1. Per chr, measure number of overlaps (type=any) of a feature in bins and their
neighbors.
pos.v=-12:12 means that measurement would be done for actual contacting bin (pos=0)
as well as for its 5 neighboring bins to the left (pos=-12:-1) and to the
right (pos=1:12). Example when pos.v=-2:2 and bin=3, overlaps will be measured in the following bins:
pos	bin	start	end
-3	NA	NA	NA
-2	1	1	40000
-1	2	40001	80000
0	3	80001	120000
1	4	120001	160000
2	5	160001	200000

FETA.MX contains all unique contacting bins per chr for a given gap threshold.
Columns with NA in FETA.MX correspond to invalid bins (bins with at least 1 base
outside the length of the chr)

The only feature I did not do this for is ct_LC_foi_B4_desc_scompRaob37 because
regions are only in chr19. 

2. Merge FETA.MX per chr into FETA.MX all chr per feature. With this FETA.MX
combining all chr data, make a boxplot of number of overlaps vs. pos/bin per 
feature.
Output (dataframe):

3. Get percentage of bins per Cp (combining bins from all chr) containing 
at least 1 feature. For cell/tissue-specific features, contacts were also
filtered based on cell/tissue.
Note that values in FETA.MX is the number of features overlapping with bin.
This value is converted to 1 signifying only the presence of overlap (not the
absolute number) because what we are interested in the % of bins overlapping with
a feature. Percentage is relative to the number of bins for each Cp category
which may vary from the expected because some bins are out of bounds of the chr
(marked NA in FETA.MX). 
The final %bins per Cp are in FETACP.MX (per feature). The bincount expected 
and actual are contained in the object bincount. bincount$act corresponds to 
FETACP.MX. Bincounts vary depending on cell/tissue or if all contacts are used
hence there's bincount object for FC, ESC, LC and hg19 (all contacts).

4. Scatter plot showing the %bins lost (per Cp, per bin position)
due to being out of bounds of chr. %bins calculated as (exp-act number of bins)/exp*100.
In the title are the expected number of bins per Cp for reference. 
5. Make two kinds of plots:
a. Fold change (FC) of %bin enrichment VS. BIN (position) 
The order in the title shows the bin position whose value is used to order the plots. 
b. Fold change (FC) of %bin enrichment VS. Cp
Fold change is relative to Cp=1 value. The order in the title shows the Cp whose
value is used to order the plots.
