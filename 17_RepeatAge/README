# Age ranking of subfamilies
################################################################################
The age ranking used for the analyses is adapted from the ranking published by 
Giordano et al. 2007. The paper gives two rankings (see
./archive/Giordano2007_ChronOrderHumanTEs_405.xls): (1) 360 retrotransposons 
(2) 405 transposons (360 retro + 15 DNA). The ranking of retrotransposons
is not the same in the two rankings but is pretty consistent. 
Most published data Iâ€™ve checked (see ./archive/PublAges_ref.csv) came before 2007 
and Giordano et al. cited them.

I had to rename some of the repeat subfamilies in the ranking to match the repeat
masker (files marked with _renamed). 

For the processing below, I used 2 starting age ranks:
a. Giordano 405 transposon ranking
b. Ranking of 136 subfamilies based on published data with actual age or age range. 
./archive/publishedAges_sorted.xlsx contains 136 sub-families with age info:
repNameRenamed	ageMyrMin	ageMyrMax	ageMyrConsensus	ConsensusMethod	Reference
L1HS	2.3	3.9	3.1	mean	14
L1PA2	5.6	9.6	7.6	mean	14
L1PA3	9.2	15.8	12.5	mean	14
L1PA4	13.2	22.8	18	mean	14
L1PA5	15	25.9	20.45	mean	14
See ./archive/PublAges_ref.csv for the paper per reference number.

# A. Finalising age ranks
################################################################################
1. I processed the two starting age ranks and combined them to come up with the 
final age rank. 

a. Subfamilies in the rankings that are not in the repeat masker were removed.
Giordano rank 405 -> 364 (Giordano2007_364HumanTEs_renamed.txt)
Published rank 136 -> 105 (Published_105HumanTEs_renamed.txt)
Subfamilies that were removed are in ./intermediatefiles/
Giordano2007_41HumanTEs_renamed_REMOVED.txt
Published_31HumanTEs_renamed_REMOVED.txt

b. Compare the two rankings. 
Output file is orderPublished_basedonGiordano.txt with list of  published
ranking and the rank of the 105 subfamily based on the Giordano ranking. 
Then, I manually incorporated 8 subfamilies from the published ranking to
the 364 Giordano rank (GiordanoANDPublished_372HumanTEs_renamed.txt).
See agerank_summary.xlsx for the process of comparison.

Giordano2007: Older elements interrepted by Younger ones
In contrast younger elements rarely interrupted by older one 

Modifications:
8 subfamilies added from published ranking (highlighted in yellow in the 
excel file):
SVA_A
SVA_B
SVA_C
SVA_D
SVA_E
SVA_F
AluYb9
AluYa8

In blue are L1PA2 and L1HS, which were switched as per advice in the Giordano 
paper. The error is because of the method they used. So I thought it's safer 
to add at the end. Only 4 repNames in published data (that appear in Repeat 
Masker) were not added. 

Final rank: 364 Giordano 2007 + 8 repeat sub-families from 105 subfamilies based 
on published data. I added them at the young portion of the Giordano ranking 
because age is more accurately determined for younger transposons than older ones. 
GiordanoANDPublished_372HumanTEs_renamed.txt

2. File with origin of repeats
Kapusta et al. 2017 has data on clade origin of some repeats. 
(./intermediatefiles/Kapusta2017_537TEsandFamilyorigin_unique529.csv)

I incorporated this to data to the final ranking but before that, I removed 
repeats in Kapusta data that are not in repeat masker even after renaming. 
(./intermediatefiles/Kapusta2017_57TEsandFamilyorigin_unique_REMOVED.txt).
472 out of 529 remain (Kapusta2017_472TEsandFamilyorigin_unique.txt).

3. File with final age ranking and additional information:
GiordanoANDPublished_372HumanTEs_renamed_withAges.csv

Output:
repName	ageMyrMin	ageMyrMax	ageMyrConsensus	ConsensusMethod	Reference	Giordano360RetroRank
MARNA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
Charlie11	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
L1MEd	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1
L3	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	3
L1ME4a	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	5
L4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	6
Tigger8	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
L1MEe	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	7

The Giordano360RetroRank column indicates the rank of the retrotransposon in the
360 retro only ranking by Giordano. The repeats are not consecutiive but switches
mainly happen among subfamilies already close to each other in the DNA + retro
final ranking.

# B. Repeat family vs. Cp
################################################################################
1. Convert repeat masker file to .RData for subsequent analyses. Additional
info (columns) were added in this object in (2).
Output: REPEAT.MX
Each row is for a repeat subfamily with unique combination of class and family.
(N=1397 subfamilies with different class and family but N=1395 unique subfamily
names):
# repClass repFamily repName
# Simple_repeat	Simple_repeat	(CATTC)n
# Satellite	Satellite	(CATTC)n
# Simple_repeat	Simple_repeat	(GAATG)n
# Satellite	Satellite	(GAATG)n

2. Add the following columns to REPEAT.MX:
a. cluster - Repeat-family-based clustering
b. Giordano364rank - ranking in Giordano 364 ranking (without the 8 subfamilies from
published ranking)
c. GiorPubl372rank - rank in final ranking
d. origin - Kapusta 2017 data on clade origin
e. Publrank, ageMyrMin, ageMyrMax, ageMyrConsensus, ConsensusMethod - for repeats 
from pulished ranking
f. Reference     

3. Plot showing the type (DNA/retrotransposon), family and cluster of repeat
subfamilies in the age ranks (GiorPubl372, Giordano364 and Publrank)

4. Characterise the clusters from the repeat family vs. Cp analysis (repeat-
faamily-based clusters). 
Plots:
a. Boxplot of copy numbers of subfamilies in each cluster. Number below box 
indicates number of subfamilies and the percentage of insertion sites in cluster
relative to total number of sites in the genome. 
b. Barplots showing fraction of sites in each cluster based on repeat class,
type and clade origin. 
c. Density of sites of repeat subfamilies represented in the age ranking for each 
cluster. Transposon subfamily 249 (L1PA16), 344 (L1PA5) and 364 (SVA_E) serve as 
time anchor points. For instance, age range of subfamilies younger than SVA_E 
(position 364) are below 5 million years.
