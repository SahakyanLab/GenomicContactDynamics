#### Figure 1. Contact persistence to isolate and investigate the core genomic contacts, their determinants and implications.

#### Figure 2. Visualisation of persistent contacts and the chromosome organisation they mediate.

#### Figure 3. Persistent contacts enriched for contacts with features associated with heterochromatin and preferential AT sequence composition.

#### Figure 4. Higher sequence complementarity between persistent contacts.

#### Figure 5. Genome-wide cII values recapitulate some Hi-C features in additional human datasets of different resolutions and in another species, Drosophila.

#### Figure 6. Repeat contribution to the observed sequence complementarity of contacts.
