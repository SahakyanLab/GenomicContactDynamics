The HapMap recombination map data orignated from Myers et al., 2005. 
	Myers, S.; Bottolo, L.; Freeman, C.; McVean, G.; Donnelly, P. A Fine-Scale Map of 
	Recombination Rates and Hotspots Across the Human Genome. Science 2005, 310, 321–324.
	
It was lifted to GRCh35 to GRCh37 by Munch et al., 2014.
	Munch, K., Mailund, T., Dutheil, J. & Schierup, M. A fine-scale recombination map of 
	the human–chimpanzee ancestor reveals faster change in humans than in chimpanzees and 
	a strong impact of GC-biased gene conversion. Genome Res 24, 467–474 (2014).

The data lifted to GRCh37 (hg190) was downloaded from the HapMap website archives 
(2011-01_phaseII_B37) and was used for the analyses.

Unzipping in R
#untar(tarfile="/Users/ltamon/ProjectBoard/HiC_contacts_dim/RecombinationRates/recombinationRates_data/genetic_map_HapMapII_GRCh37.tar.gz", 
#list=FALSE, exdir="/Users/ltamon/ProjectBoard/HiC_contacts_dim/RecombinationRates/recombinationRates_data/recomRates_2011-01_phaseII_B37_Myers")
#list=FALSE means it will extract the data, if TRUE it will just return a list of files
