# A. Finalise non-coding mutation data set
################################################################################
1. Explore COSMIC non-coding mutation data. Did the following:
a. Extract sample dataset -- first 2000 columns of the table.
b. Explore possible entries per table column. Calculate starting total number
of mutations.
- Check if duplicated GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID correspond to duplicated LEGACY_MUTATION_ID.
- Zygosity - We don't care because our contacts are not stranded.

c. Check how many entries with multiple mutations at the same site to be removed. 
These are entries with the same sample id (or sample name) and same location of mutation. 

ID_SAMPLE - Need alternative to ID_SAMPLE because a sample can have multiple ids, 
if the same sample has been entered into the database multiple times from different 
papers. The alternative is a CUSTOM ID made by concatenating the following columns:
Primary site, Site subtype 1, Site subtype 2, Site subtype 3, Primary histology,
Histology subtype 1, Histology subtype 2 and Histology subtype 3. 

The code removes entries with duplicated (a) ID_SAMPLE-genome position, 
(b) CUSTOM ID-genome position and (c) Sample_name-genome position. 

d. The genomic mutation identifier (COSV), GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID, indicates the 
definitive position of the variant on the genome so check for samples with the same 
GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID but different genomic position. Note that entries can have
the same GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID but should be from different samples. There should
be no entry with the same GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID from the same sample if
entries from same sample and same position are removed (c). 

2. Apply filtering based on checks done in (1), liftover to hg19 and conversion 
to 1-based coordinate system to get the final non-coding mutation working dataset. 

a. Check for NAs per column.
b. Extract chr, start, end coordinate from genome position. Convert 0-based 
coordinates to 1-based.
c. Liftover to hg19 if required. Remove mutations that were split after liftover
(from single base to two or more).
d. Filter:
- Remove entries with the multiple mutations at same site. Use only ID_SAMPLE and
Sample name for this. Custom id was not used because the columns used to make it 
mostly contain NS (not specified).
- Remove entries with same GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID but different position.
- Mutation somatic status - Take only mutations that were confirmed to be somatic
Confirmed Somatic = if the mutation has been confimed to be somatic in the 
experiment by sequencing both the tumour and a matched normal from the same patient.
- Check if WT_SEQ and MUT_SEQ only contain valid bases (upper and lower case
but the data only uses upper case).
- Only take entries with single base mutation (start and end coorindates the same).
- Only take mutations from autosomal chromosomes (chr1-22). 
- Only take mutations found from whole genome sequencing experiments. Note that some
entries are "n" for both whole genome and whole exome sequencing. I only took entries
that yes/y for whole genome and no/n for whole exome. 
- Convert 
ncv.df$MUT[ncv.df$MUT=="T>G"] <- "A>C"
ncv.df$MUT[ncv.df$MUT=="T>C"] <- "A>G"
ncv.df$MUT[ncv.df$MUT=="T>A"] <- "A>T"
ncv.df$MUT[ncv.df$MUT=="G>T"] <- "C>A"
ncv.df$MUT[ncv.df$MUT=="G>C"] <- "C>G"
ncv.df$MUT[ncv.df$MUT=="G>A"] <- "C>T"
- Made sure that there are no problematic WT_SEQ and MUT_SEQ (e.g. missing or >1 bp). 
I checked that mutation types can only be one of the 6 possibilities above.

No filtering against variants that are SNPs (~60K entries in the hg38ToHg19 CosmicNCV
dataset). 
For subsequent test runs, a sample dataset (first 2000 entries) were extracted from
the final filtered dataset. 

e. Additional possible filtering (not applied):
- SNP - choose "n"
All the known SNPs are flagged as 'y' defined by the 1000 genomes project, dbSNP 
and a panel of 378 normal (non-cancer) samples from Sanger CGP sequencing.

- FATHMM_MKL_NON_CODING_SCORE - Get mutations that are considered pathogenic
(>=0.7)
- some are missing
"Scores above 0.5 are deleterious, but in order to highlight the most significant 
data in COSMIC, only scores ≥ 0.7 are classified as 'Pathogenic'. Mutations are 
classed as 'Neutral' if the score is ≤ 0.5."
https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/analyses

- FATHMM_MKL_NON_CODING_GROUPS 
Each functional score is classified into 10 groups of features, depending on 
whether it is a coding or non-coding variant. Please see the original publication 
for more details regarding the feature classification (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv009).

3.  Make sure that per sample, each site has only 1 or no mutation. 

4. Plot:
a. Total mutations per ID_SAMPLE in the dataset. Also calculates the mean and
median of the total mutations per sample and the number of unique ID_SAMPLE.
b. Total mutations per nucleotide site per chromosome. Make plot for all and each
mutation type (e.g. A>C). 

Number of mutations per nucleotide site. Also calculates number of unique
ID_SAMPLE and the mean and mode of mutations. 
################################################################################
# B. Mutations per nucleotide site of a bin
################################################################################
1. Mutation frequency per nucleotide site in a bin (done per chr). Output is
FETA.MX.
2. Merge FETA.MX from all chr.
3. Consolidate data from FETA.MX into Cp categories. Only contacting bins 
present in given cell line / tissue were considered. Output is FETACP.MX which
contains number of nucleotide site per Cp with at least one mutation.
4. Count nucleotide site considered per bin. 
5. Plot number of mutated site across Cp and number of mutations per site for
all Cp=21 bins. 
################################################################################
# C. Mutations per bin
################################################################################
1. Take mutation file, assign mutated sites to bin and then calculate per bin

a. Tmut - number of mutations 
b. Nmsite - number of mutated sites (in at least one sample in the cosmic data)
c. TmutDIVNmsite - Tmut/Nmsite
d. Nmsitenorm - Nmsite/number of wildtype base in the bin 
	- for A>C, divide by the number of As in the bin
	- If considering all types of mutations, divide by bin length. This is regardless
	if the sequence has missing base or not. This is because the missing base will
	be part of the sum anyway since it can only be one of the 4 bases. 
	- Nmsitenorm missing values correspond to bins with missing A,C,G,T content
	because they have Ns in their sequence

See ~/GCD_polished/2_Expl_contacts for script calculating base content per bin.
	
2. Table of Tmut, Nmsite, TmutDIVNmsite and Nmsitenorm per bin. Indicate also which
Cp/s the bin belongs to. Using this table make boxplots of the 4 calculations in C1 
per Cp.

All bins involved in long-range contacts were considered. Plot title contains: 
(i) number of contributing bins per Cp
(ii) number of bins per Cp with at least one mutated site and (iii) the percentage of (ii) 
relative to (i). 

3. Hexbin plot Tmut, Nmsite, TmutDIVNmsite and Nmsitenorm vs. weighted mean Cp 
with (wmeanCp0) and without (wmeanCp) considering Cp=0 long-range contacts. 
See ~/GCD_polished/2_Expl_contacts for script calculating weighted mean Cp.
