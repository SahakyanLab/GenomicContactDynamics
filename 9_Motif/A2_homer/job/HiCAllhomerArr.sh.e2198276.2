	Motif length set at 8,9,10,11,12,
	Using actual sizes of regions (-size given)
	Fragment size set to given
	Will optimize 5 putative motifs
	Using 4 CPUs
	Using 100 MB for statistics cache
	Will randomize and repeat motif finding 3 times to estimate FDR

	Peak File Statistics:
		Total Peaks: 7818
		Redundant Peak IDs: 0
		Peaks lacking information: 0 (need at least 5 columns per peak)
		Peaks with misformatted coordinates: 0 (should be integer)
