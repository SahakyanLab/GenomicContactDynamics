# De novo motif discovery and motif analysis of HiC contact bins with Homer via

################################################################################
1. Plot length distribution of 426 homer known motifs (5-16-2018 / v4.10)
The .motif files are stored in homer/motifs. This was done to decide the range of 
motif lengths to be subsequently used.

2. Homer known motif analysis and de novo discovery.
Generate bed files of target (targ) and background (bgr) HiC contact bins. The
targ/bgr sequences is randomly sampled with size based on samp.size variable (%).
UNIQBIN.DF is used for sampling. Note that before sampling, bins with at least
1 missing base were removed so percentage sampled is relative to number
of bins without missing base.

# Motif analysis (de novo and known)
find_motifs_genome(
  x=bed,
  path = out.dir,
  # or add "r" for repeat-masked version e.g. "hg19r"
  genome = "hg19",
  # Vector of motif lengths to consider [default is c(8, 10, 12)]
  # Not advisable to look for motifs longer than 12 bp. Start with shorter
  # lengths and once you get promising motifs, try longer ones
  motif_length = 8:12,
  scan_size = "given",
  # Default optimize_count = 8
  # Specifies the number of motifs of each length to find
  optimize_count = 5,
  background = paste0(out.dir, "/", suffix, "_bgr"),
  local_background = FALSE,
  only_known = FALSE, 
  # Default fdr_num = 0; for de novo discovery,
  only_denovo = FALSE,
  fdr_num = 3,
  cores = 4, 
  cache = 100,
  overwrite = TRUE, 
  keep_minimal = FALSE
) 

## Default Parameters:
## Sequences not masked for repeats
## -mis Allowed mismatches set to 2
## -gc (use GC% for sequence content normalization, now the default)
## CG normalization
## Homer looks for motifs on both strands


## HOMER will still try to normalize the background to remove GC-bias and 
## will also perform autonormalization, normalization can be turned off
## Extract sequences from the genome corresponding to the regions in the 
## input file, filtering sequences that are >70% "N"
## Custom background regions provided are still GC-normalized and HOMER
## makes sure regions don't overlap with target regions

# Interpretation of results
## Enrichment p-values reported by HOMER should be very very significant
## (i.e. << 1e-50).  If this is not the case, there is a strong possibility
## that the experiment may have failed in one way or another. 
## In principle, in a motif is present in less than 5% of the targets 
## sequences, there may be a problem
