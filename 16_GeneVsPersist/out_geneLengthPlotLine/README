I renamed repeat lengths from e.g., len_full_repeat to len_repeat_full to so I
can plot total lengths of genic elements and repeat content together assigning
different point shapes. But, I have not generated plots using this new code
because I decided to not plot them together since the two fold changes are
independent of each other. In other words the plots here were generated when 
both types of lengths are not distinguished.
