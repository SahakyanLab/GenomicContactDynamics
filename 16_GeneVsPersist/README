# A. Genes co-localising with contacts per Cp category
################################################################################
0. Examine UCSC annotation table

1. Clean the annotation table by:
a. Get only the relevant chromosomes in UCSC annotation tabe (chr1:22, "X", "Y")
b. Add unique ID for each row in tables (for future analyses e.g. mapping to 
persist bins). Note that unique ID is the row number of the transcript in the full
annotation table (filtered for relevant chromosomes).
c. Separate tables into reference sequence categories. Accession numbers beginning 
with NM (coding) and NR (non-coding).
d. Make HUGOsymbol-EntrezID conversion table for future analyses (e.g. KEGG 
pathway analysis)

2. Map transcripts to HiC contact bins (any type of overlap). Both the gene name 
of transcript (name2 column) and the uniqueID were mapped.

2.5 Plot distribution of HiC signal count (Cs) per tissue per chromosome. Determine
fraction change of high and low Cs contacts for a given Cs break.
Output: Fraction change of count (HIGH-LOW)/LOW X HiC signal count break

Ex. If the break is Cs=10, how many contacts will fall into low Cs (=<10)
and high Cs (>10) categories.

3. Per chr, identify genes co-localising with contacts per Cp category
Per chr, one text file with gene names, one text file with uniqueID. 
In the output text files, name2 (genes) and uniqueID (transcript) are unique
per category.

4. Union of genes from all chr
Note: Header with no genes still have an additional line containing "" not NULL 
or NA, length==1. In the output text files, name2 (genes) and uniqueID (transcript) 
are unique per category ( union() removes duplicates )

5. GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment for genes per Cp. Output is a csv file. 
Use HUGO symbols for GO analysis while Entrez gene IDs for KEGG analysis.  

6. Make heatmap combining the gene enrichment analyses results for all Cps.

7. Make simplified plot of GO/KEGG term enrichment results for a given set
of genes and background using funxAnno(). 
In the plot title, e.g. min2Mb_ALL_cp_cp21cpHiCall_KEGG, "cp21cpHiCall" means that 
the foreground genes are cp21 genes and the background are genes overlapping with all 
LR Hi-C contacts (foreback.combi = "cp_21;cp_HiC_all").

Gene count in plot means the number of genes associated with the certain term.
The gene count in the legend name (enclosed in parentheses) is the total number of
foreground genes associated with at least one term. 

7.5. Plot DAVID functional annotation clusters of terms enriched in given gene set.
From the functional annotation clustering result, get terms enriched from topN clusters
with highest EASE score. In the plot, significance is shown by the $log_{10}$-transformed Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value (BH to match adjusted
p-value in A7). Red dashed line marks -log10(0.05)~1.3010 and only terms with
adjusted p-value greater than that value in at least 1 sample are displayed. Gene
count is the number of prime contact bin genes associated with each term. 

Perform this using samples of Cp=21 genes (A9). Each panel in plot corresponds to
a sample denoted by the seed number used to generate it. Only 2999 was sampled
because in the case of sample 754, DAVID maps 3000 DAVID identifiers to 2999
genes. For the clustering the medium stringency setting was used and the
background is the built-in set of Homo sapiens genes. The enrichment score or
EASE of clusters is the negative log transformed geometric mean of the enrichment
p-values (a modified Fisher exact p-value) of member terms
\cite{huang_systematic_2009}. The EASE scores per cluster per sample are not shown
but ranges from to 2.1859 to 8.1766 (-log(0.05)~2.9957$).

8. Make a text file of genes colocalising with Cp of interest. This is for 
DAVID.

9. Generate samples of genes from gene sets in \out_geneFilePerCp. This is 
because DAVID can only take at most 3000 genes for functional annotation 
clustering. The code generates two files:

a. List of genes from files in \out_geneFilePerCp chosen based on gene
format (official gene symbol or Entrez gene id).
b. Samples of genes from (a) of given length and seed. Before sampling,
genes that cannot be mapped by DAVID (out_DAVID/unmapped) were removed.
2999 genes were sampled because sometimes DAVID matches N+1 DAVID IDs
to N input genes (as in the case of seed=754). Three samples of the same length
(N=2999) were generated to make sure that results are stable. 
################################################################################
# B. Gene length vs. Cp
################################################################################
Only coding mRNA was used for these analyses. 

1. UniqueIDs of longest transcripts per Cp. Same format as A4 but only uniqueIDs
of longest transcript per category. For the rest of gene length studies, only
coding mRNAs are considered but here, output files were also produced for NR
and ALL (both NR and NM) transcripts. 

2. Make table containing (complete and repeat-free versions for each length):
TRANSCRIPT.L <- transcript length
N.EXONS <- exon count
N.INTRONS <- intron count
EXONS.L <- summed exon lengths
INTRONS.L <- summed intron lengths
MEAN.EXON.L <- mean single exon length 
MEAN.INTRON.L <- mean single intron length 
INTRONS.dev.EXONS <- total intron to exon ratio

This requires bedfiles of transcripts, exons and introns that are repeat-free.
Obtain using subtractbed from bedtools to get Transcipt portions with no repeats
  # Inputs are the beds for each length
  # Output file = <genome.ver>anno_<refseq>_repFreeTr.bed
  # -s force same strandedness, -f min overlap 1bp (default)
  # Shell: subtractBed -s -f 1E-9 -a hg19anno_ALL_tr.bed -b hg19_repeat.bed > hg19anno_ALL_repFreeTr.bed
  # Shell: subtractBed -s -f 1E-9 -a hg19anno_ALL_exon.bed -b hg19_repeat.bed > hg19anno_ALL_repFreeEx.bed
  # Shell: subtractBed -s -f 1E-9 -a hg19anno_ALL_intron.bed -b hg19_repeat.bed > hg19anno_ALL_repFreeInt.bed
} 

Output: ANNOLENGTH.DF

3. Plot lengths vs. Cp

4. Make scatter plots showing the fold change of mean lengths in reference to
Cp=1. Plot of log2(MeanCp=N/MeanCp=1) X Cp
Plot data: LENCP (Cp-L), L is actual length/10^3
################################################################################
# C. Genecentric approach
################################################################################
1. 1-to-1 correspondence of gene with Cp (max Cp across transcript). Similar output
as A4 but genes classifed based on its highest Cp. 
################################################################################
# D. Equalise length of transcript before doing Gene Vs. Cp
################################################################################
This to remove the bias of longer transcripts having more contacts overlapping
(shown in plot from Step 2., wherein number of contacts overlapping is somehow
directly proportional to transcript length)

0. Identify longest transcript per gene. Output saved in 
/Users/ltamon/Database/ucsc_tables/hsa_geneAnno

1. Make a file of Cs (per tissue) and Cp values per minimum distance between
contacting regions (min2Mb/min05Mb)

2. # Equalise length of transcripts and make an annotation table of 
# chr-unique ID-HUGO symbol-newTxStart-newTxEnd (saved in Database)
# Equalise based on a reference length (Lref):
# a. mean of trancript lengths (ave)
# b. 2 SDs from mean of transcript lengths (m2sd)
# Also make a plot of transcript lengths with the Lref indicated

Output annotation table (ave and m2sd) in 
/Users/ltamon/Database/ucsc_tables/hsa_geneAnno

3. Map equalised transcripts (orig, ave, m2sd) to HiC contact bins. 

4. Per transcript, count the number of its overlapping contacts having 
Cs/Cp values per tissue.

Output: TRCOUNT.MX (unique ID X CpCs values). Rownames are the unique ID. In the 
example above, colnames are the possible Cs values for TLC tissue. Cp is treated 
as tissue in the code. 

5. Combine TRCOUNT.MX of all chr.

6. Plot transcript's length vs. number of contacts overlapping with it. 
Results show a somehow directly proportional relationship.

7. Make files of genes for gene enrichment analysis, per tissue (including Cp)
a. background - all genes co-localising with contact
b. Top5percent - genes co-localising with contact within top 5% of extr

8. Binary heatmap of GO/KEGG terms combining all tissues + cp (with and without
equalisation of length). There is a checkpoint to make sure that all terms are
called are significant (p.adjust < 0.05).
